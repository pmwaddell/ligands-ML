Things that are needed:

* rdkit, basically everything in the rdkit-env environment except like autode I think.
* ORCA (make sure you check the parallel option), with the absolute path indicated in config.yaml.
* Microsoft MPI I assume

* Separate environment for DBSTEP, potentially. That's how I'm doing it now, at least.
