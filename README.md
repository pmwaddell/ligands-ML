> Experiments in applying machine learning and chemometrics to ligand design for transition metal catalysts.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/pmwaddell/ligands-ML)

## Setup (WORK IN PROGRESS!)

Things that are needed:

* rdkit, basically everything in the rdkit-env environment except like autode I think.
* ORCA (make sure you check the parallel option), with the absolute path indicated in config.yaml.
* Microsoft MPI

* Separate environment for DBSTEP, potentially. That's how I'm doing it now, at least. But we may not even end up using it.
